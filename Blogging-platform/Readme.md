# Project 2: Blogging Platform

## 📌 Overview

This is **Project 2**, a blogging platform developed as part of our academic curriculum. It includes essential blogging features such as:

- 📝 Creating posts  
- ✏️ Editing existing content  
- ❌ Deleting posts  
- 👀 Viewing blogs from all users

## 🤝 Team Collaboration (Clarification)

Although this project was assigned as a **team collaboration**, the practical work was carried out individually by me due to the lack of contributions from other team members.

The implementation is based on a **YouTube tutorial**, which I followed to understand the concepts and complete the project. I learned how full-stack applications are built using modern technologies and gained hands-on experience with the MERN stack.
